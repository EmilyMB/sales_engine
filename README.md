# Sales Engine
This project sets up relations between multiple datasets involving customers, merchants, items, and transactions.

The project was initially completed in December 2014 as a pair-project by [Emily](http://github.com/EmilyMB) and [Manny](http://github.com/gomav) at [Turing School](http://turing.io) and updated by Emily in May 2015. Project expectations are outlined [here](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/sales_engine.html).
